# barrelclash

The purpose of **barrelclash** is to train the accuracy of your intuition as to where the Goblin Barrel from Clash Royale will land.

It was completed as a quick for fun project to practice catching Goblin Barrels for my own gameplay, so the code is knowingly not easily expandable.

To run this project clone it and open up the terminal:
`npm install`

This command will install all the dependencies in the project.

Run to start the server
`node ./start.js`

Then connect to `localhost:3000`
